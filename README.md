# Linear-Regression-Experiment-with-Housing-data

A experiment using linear regression aimed at predicting the monetary value of houses. 

When buyers are looking at prospective houses there are multiple factors to consider. In this project linear regression will be used to predict the selling price of houses based on several varying features in the Ames housing data set. There are 81 different features in the dataset varying from id to heating to LotArea. (Too many to list and describe in a table)
